# Steamunity 2024: Introducing the RIZZ BUZZ
A project made for the Steamunity: Design for Community Challenge hosted by SUTD, Singapore. 
Our group consisting of Daksh, Jarrett, Jason, Xiu Ling, Tiffany, and Richard, have designed an innovate doorbell system to help elderlies who have hearing impairments.

### We thus present... THE RIZZ BUZZ 
You can't resist the pure, unfiltered RIZZ of the very, very comfortable wristband that sends out visual, audio and vibration cues that provides the ***ultimate*** sensual experience.
Whenever our modified doorbell is pressed, it sends a signal to the wristband, alerting wearers to answer the door. 
The doorbell comes with a screen, letting visitors know whether an elderly has acknowledged, and likewise, the wristband comes with an acknowledge button.
