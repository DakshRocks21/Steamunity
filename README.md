# Steamunity 2024: Creating a Doorbell System for elderlies with Hearing Impairments
A project made for the Steamunity: Design for Community Challenge hosted by SUTD, Singapore. 
Our group consisting of Daksh, Jarrett, Jason, Xiu Ling, Tiffany, and Richard, have designed an innovate doorbell system to help elderlies who have hearing impairments.

### We thus present... THE RIZZ BUZZ 
Nobody can resist the pure, unfiltered attractivity of our very, _very comfortable_ "rizz"-band that sends out visual, audio and vibration cues, providing the ***ultimate*** sensual experience.
Whenever our modified doorbell is pressed, it sends a signal to the wristband and activates it, compelling wearers to answer the door ***IMMEDIATELY***.
Furthermore, the doorbell comes with a screen! lIt keeps visitors in the know on whether the homeowner has acknowledged, and likewise, the wristband comes with an acknowledge button.
